### STEPS TO REFACTORING

        <!-- FRONT END BASICS TO BE BUILT. -->
        - Start with the search bar and the creation of a todo

        - Make sure the creation of each todo comes under each other, (appending).

        - Add the number count of each todo created, to find the sum total of all the todos on the Todo List.
        
        - Add the basic features such as edit, delete, and time and date created for each todo created.
        
        - Code the basic features (edit and delete), and make sure that they work, even for each todo (for every specific todo created)
        
        - Add the special features such as viewing the active, completed and the clearing of the todos, when you don't need them anymore
        
        - Make the data of the todos persist even when the user reloads and comes back. (Local Storage).

        - add styling after you've developed
