# Other features to build, after the front-end has been built

        <!-- Special features 2 FRONTEND FEATURES-->
        - Add drag and drop for each todos, to reposition all todos to their new arrangement.
        - Add a timer for the focus feature, and store each user's data, of them doing the todo on the backend, so that they can retrieve it, when they log in, or sign-up.

        <!-- BACKEND FEATURE -->
        - [For Backend] - Enable user to know when the todo will end (add duration and time for the todo to last until it expires).
        - Add focus period for the user, when he or she is doing the todo, so they complete it without getting distracted, and tick it off.


        <!-- BACKEND TO BE BUILT AFTER FRONTEND HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. -->
        - When the Backend is introduced (Firebase), enable the user to store his or her data on the database via logging in, or signing up.
